     Roving observer file.  This contains "MPC codes" for observers who
  don't have MPC codes,  mostly satellite observers.  Also,  MPC provides
  wrong or imprecise coordinates for many obscodes,  and/or lumps many
  telescopes spread out over a mountaintop under one obscode.  This file
  provides corrected locations in such cases.

     Locations can be in the MPC standard longitude/rho_cos_phi/rho_sin_phi
  triplet format,  or as lon/lat/altitude.  So far,  MPC has used codes
  with starting characters 0-9 or A-Z,  followed by two digits.  So I've
  used three letter codes,  often mixed-case,  ideally giving a hint as
  to the observatory.  One is not limited to alphanumerics;  note the use
  of '2.2' and '0.6' for the Maunakea 2.2-meter and 0.6-meter scopes.
  Characters from ASCII 33 = '!' to 126='~' can be used,  for 94^3=830584
  possible observatory codes.  That should last for a while.

     Altitudes marked with '?' are usually just copied from the altitude
  given for a nearby telescope,  and may not be completely accurate.

     The '!' in column 5 indicates that the data depart from the usual MPC
  format.  The observatory name starts in column 48,  rather than column
  31,  to allow more precision.  It also gives room to specify a non-Earth
  based observer (see examples below for planets,  MSL,  LCROSS and Chang'e
  5-T1 booster impact points,  Lagrange points,  etc.)  It allows for
  four-character MPC codes.  Punched-card format astrometry won't support
  those,  but ADES will,  and some of my software allows one to request
  (for example) ephemerides from a four-character "MPC code".  I may
  support such codes by allowing 81-column astrometry,  though that would
  force us to abandon punched cards.

     Longitudes and latitudes are either in decimal degree or deg/min/sec
  form.  See,  e.g.,  (273) EISCAT for an example of the latter.  East and
  North are positive.  For West 82.3 degrees,  you could use either -82.3
  or 277.7 (implied east),  or 2774200. or -821800.

     Altitudes are in meters above the (WGS84) ellipsoid.  The difference
  between ellipsoidal altitudes and above sea level altitudes can be up
  to about 100 meters.  Gareth Williams tells me that MPC has been careful
  about asking people which flavor of altitude they're using.  If they
  give an ASL elevation,  he corrects it to an ellipsoidal one using the
  EGM96 model.  Google Earth altitudes are ASL and therefore always
  corrected;  GPS positions have to be flagged so that MPC can know
  whether to correct them.

     To get the correction ("geoid height") between ellipsoidal and
  geodetic (sea level) altitudes,  use this :

  http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/GeoidEval

     Any line in this file starting with a space is assumed to be a
  comment.  Negative longitudes (and those between 180 and 360) are in
  the Western Hemisphere.

   NOTE that rather than add codes here,  one can use code (247),  the
   "roving observer",  as described at

   https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/info/RovingObs.html

   _Or_,  one can use code (XXX),  as described at

   https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/info/Astrometry.html#HowObsCode

   For this last,  one uses code XXX,  and inserts a line at the top of the
   observations such as

   COM Long. 239 18 45 E, Lat. 33 54 11 N, Alt. 100m, Google Earth

   Note that MPC is rather strict about the above format (east longitudes
   only,  degrees/minutes/seconds).  Find_Orb is more flexible -- you can
   use any "code",  meaning you can even move existing codes,  and you can
   use decimal degrees and West longitudes if you wish -- but don't expect
   MPC to understand what you've done.

      Also note that some information about codes can be gathered via URLs
   of the form

   https://cgi.minorplanetcenter.net/cgi-bin/cgipy/obscode?obscode=xxx

      where xxx=code in question.  This can (sometimes) get you an 'owner',
   which may help in tracking down information about a particular site.
   My thanks to Peter Birtwhistle for pointing this out to me.

   Lagrange points are approximate (but good approximation) fictions.
   L1, L2,  and L3 are assumed to lie in straight lines with both bodies
   at fractions based on the relative masses of the objects. L4 and L5
   are at equilateral triangle points. Perturbations are ignored.  I
   don't expect observations to be made from these points;  this is
   really so you can compute ephemerides from these locations.  For
   each point,  the indices for the primary and secondary object are
   given (moon=10);  then fraction of distance from primary to secondary,
   and then fraction "along orbit" (non-zero for L4 and L5,  where the
   value is +/- sqrt(.75) to make the equilateral triangle.)  For
   example,  EM1 is 84.906% of the way from the earth to the moon.  See
   'lagrange.c' in the 'junk' repository for mathematical details and
   code to generate these values for other systems.

   Note that ephems generated from these spacecraft require auxiliary
   files saying where the spacecraft were at a given time.  I don't
   distribute those files by default,  because (a) some of them are
   large and (b) you can only go just so far into the future before
   they may not be entirely accurate.  Should you want ephems for
   objects as seen from these spacecraft,  or any other spacecraft
   listed on JPL's Horizons system,  contact me.  (I may set this up
   so that Find_Orb just looks for the relevant ephems on Horizons,
   as you need them.)

   There are at least eleven telescopes on Maunakea.  Until 2022 Oct 7,
   all (with a few exceptions) were lumped as (568).  Some are not very
   close to the position specified for (568).  See
   http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.5835 for an example where the difference
   matters -- admittedly unusual,  involving a close-in artificial object;
   there have been a few NEOs where it also mattered.  The following list
   is from: http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/IRrefdata/telescope_ref_data.php,
   and/or http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/mko/coordinates.shtml (same data).
      I had doubts about these lat/lon/alts,  derived from an aerial survey
   and in NAD83 datum,  with altitudes in feet (data given in non-metric
   units always makes me worry) and given to a meaningless precision of
   about 0.3 millimeters -- those sorts of mistakes usually mean bogus data
   -- but checks with people who have actually been on Maunakea with GPS
   units and by Dave Tholen (see below) have assuaged those worries.
      Lat/lon/alts in this file are supposed to be on the WGS84 ellipsoid.
   I just took the NAD83 lat/longs and ignored the difference (about two
   meters).  I increased altitudes by 26 meters,  the approximate geoid
   height given by

   https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/cgi-bin/GeoidEval?input=19.82528+-155.46887&option=Submit

      to convert heights above sea level (or,  equivalently,  above the geoid)
   to heights above the WGS84 ellipsoid.
      No altitudes were given for JCMT and CSO.  4190 meters (increased by
   26 meters) seemed at least roughly in the ballpark of the altitudes for
   the other telescopes.
      Note also that the MPC position for (568) corresponds to longitude
   -155.4722,  lat 19.8262,  4202 meters.  After allowing for roundoff
   (only five digits on parallaxes!),  this looks like the correct
   position for IRTF.
      Dave Tholen has gotten a precise measurement for the 2.2-m scope
   by imaging navigation satellites.  The resulting position was 1.3133e-5
   degrees (about 1.46 meters) north,  2.6364e-5 degrees (about 2.76 meters)
   west,  and 4.975 meters higher than the aerial survey position.  We think
   the aerial survey is internally consistent,  so I've added the same
   offset to the other Maunakea scopes in that survey.
      Note that (2.2), (CFH),  and (Sub) now have official MPC codes (T12),
   (T14),  and (T09).  I've retained the three older codes for historical
   compatibility,  but you should now use the officially blessed codes.

   The coordinates supplied for these stations by the MPC are
   given to 10^-6 Earth radius (in latitude/altitude),  which
   is about six meters.  At least one radar observation is
   given with a sigma of 0.05 microseconds.  That's a round-trip
   time;  in 25 nanoseconds,  light travels about 7.5 meters.  So
   we ought to replace the MPC parallax data with the following
   lat/lon/alts.  The precision in lat/lon is about 0.3 mm,
   with room for two more digits (3-micron precision).  Go and
   try making _that_ insufficient precision,  radar guys!

   Coordinates for Cerro Tololo and Cerro Pachon telescopes,  from
   https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1616 , Table 6.  Note that some positions
   given here don't match those given by MPC's ObsCodes.html.  In
   particular,  the location for (I33) given by MPC is about half a
   kilometer west of reality (compared to the above reference,  and the
   map and lat/lon given at https://noirlab.edu/science/images/soar-map,
   and inspection on G__gle Maps).  I am reasonably sure that (I02) 2MASS,
   and five LCO telescopes are among those listed below,  but matching
   up the telescopes listed below to their MPC codes is difficult;
   the area is a packed array of domes,  and the MPC coordinates are
   not up to the job of puzzling out which scope is which.  Also,
   the altitude listed for LSST is ~15m below the planned altitude
   of the pier floor,  which is in turn somewhere below the point where
   the optical axis crosses the altitude axis (the point we really
   want when we say "where the telescope is").  So my bet is that
   most of these altitudes are at least a few meters lower than they
   really should be.

   https://www.eso.org/public/usa/teles-instr/lasilla/ provides a map of
   telescopes at La Silla,  enabling me to identify the following scopes
   and measure lat/lon/alts on G__gle Earth.  MPC lumps these at (809)
   and (262),  which appear to be for NTT,  and (I40) TRAPPIST.  I've
   added a 34 metre geoid height to the Google values.
   Mike Kretlow points out that (262) probably corresponds to the 1-m
   ESO Schmidt.  I'm not moving (262) quite yet,  but that does look
   as if it would be the right thing to do.
   (gpo) observed from 1968 June 6 until it was decommissioned in 1996
   and replaced by the 1-m MarLy telescope (now also decommissioned in
   2009),  so (gpo) and (Ma1) have identical coordinates.  The GPO is
   now at the Observatoire Haut-Provence in France (see (GPO) below).

   https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/astroclimate/site.html gives
   latitude/longitude for not only each of the four "unit telescopes"
   making up the VLT;  it also gives lat/longs for the many auxiliary
   telescopes.  However,  they're all given as being at 2635.43 meters
   above sea level.  The geoid height is 33.91 meters for UT1 (using
   EGM96),  resulting in an ellipsoidal height of 2369.34 meters.
   I'll go with that until we get better data...
   Incidentally,  there are actually four 1.8-m auxiliary telescopes.
   But they can be moved to any of the thirty locations CPA0 to CPM0
   given below.
   (X11) = VLT Survey Telescope (VST) is omitted.  The MPC location is
   only six meters lower and one meter away from the position given
   at the above URL.  (309) is in the midst of UT1, 2, 3, 4,  but its
   altitude is about 32 meters too low.  I think ObsCodes.html is
   using a geoid height where it should use an ellipsoidal one.

   a _geoid_ height (from Google Earth) of 105 metres;  this was
   misinterpreted as an _ellipsoid_ altitude in the MPC's file.
   The following will override that mistake,  adding in the
   47.6-m geoid height for Peter's location.  (MPC has fixed this.
   But the following coordinates are more precise,  and Peter
   observes a lot of artsats,  where the added precision matters.)

   Spacewatch telescope positions are off.  (691) was wrong by
   almost half a kilometer,  but fixed January 2019.  (291) is still
   wrong,  though only by about 20 meters.  Altitude is from

   with 30 meters subtracted for geoid height.  (695) corresponds to
   the 0.7-m Solar Vacuum Telescope and should probably be moved,  but
   I don't know where.

   Again,  I subtracted 30 meters for geoid height.  The odd mismatch in
   precision for latitude and longitude makes me suspect mistakes.

   The MDM Observatory at Kitt Peak has the 1.3-m McGraw-Hill Telescope and
   the 2.4-m Hiltner Telescope,  separated by roughly 60 meters.
   I've measured both scopes on Google Maps;  Eric Galayda provided
   altitudes and IDs as to which scope was which (not really apparent
   from just looking at Google Maps). As with other Kitt Peak scopes, 30
   meters is subtracted from the geoid heights to get ellipsoidal heights.

   Positions for some Haleakala scopes.  Sorting out which was which was done
   thanks to input from people who have worked there over the decades.  Positions
   measured from Google Earth.  Altitude for (T05) is from the MPC file and is
   good to 1e-6 Earth radius = 6.3 meters.  Altitudes for (F65) and (608) are
   from the same source,  but given to one less digit = 63 meter precision.
   DKIST alt is from https://dkist.nso.edu/faq,  with a 17 meter geoid height
   added.  Which puts it pretty high up above everything else.  Everybody else
   has a 'guessed' altitude of 3050 meters above the ellipsoid.

   are about 1230m above sea level (geoid height is 48 meters).  (Sc2)
   used to report (204) data,  but has been discontinued.  Luca tells me
   (Sc3),  a smaller dome between the two,  houses a C14 that will be
   remotely controlled in early 2021 (hasn't actually submitted any data).

   G__gle Maps shows five domes on Calar Alto.  MPC gives five codes.  (493),
   "Calar Alto",  has low precision;  I have no idea which scope is intended.
   (Observations on the 2019 Oct 10 MPCs say data came from a 1.23-m scope,
   a 1.23-m f/8 scope,  a 1.2-m f/8 scope,  and a 3.5-m f/3.9 scope.)
   (Z84) and (Z79) were identifiable.  I _think_ (G36) = Un1.  Alts are from
   G__gle Earth,  with 51m added for geoid height.  According to Wikipaedia,
   (Z79) = 3.5m scope;  (Z84) = 0.8-m Schmidt; (Un1) = 1.23m;  (Un2) = 1.5m;
   (Un3) = 2.2m. Z84 is removed from this rovers list as the elevation has
   been corrected.

   Carolin Liefke sorted out the history of (024) Heidelberg-Konigstuhl
   (see https://groups.io/g/mpml/message/35417).  The site listed below as
   (024) was used by observers at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy
   until about 2013.  The MPIA was founded in 1967.  Observations from 1898
   to 1967 were made at the Landessternwarte Konigstuhl (LSW) site,  given
   below as (HeK),  with a 6" double astrograph before 1900 and the 16"
   Bruce double astrograph after that.  Later observations were probably
   all made at the (024) MPIA site with a 70-cm Cassegrain.  Locations from
   G__gle Earth,  48 metres added for geoid height.

   about 2.2 km NW from the above He* cluster.  This is presumably the
   site used by Wolf until the above (HeK) site site opened on 1898 June 20.

   MPC has the wrong vowel in the observatory name.  John W. Briggs writes :
   "Astronomer Lewis Morris Rutherfurd was a major benefactor to Columbia and
   a trustee, and the Observatory is named after him.  But even on the
   Department's website now (last I checked, anyway) they manage to continue
   to spell Rutherfurd's last name wrong."
   http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/pupin.html provides further
   info,  putting the observatory at that spot when (795) was reporting
   data to MPC (1936 to 1940).  Coordinates from G__gle Earth,  which
   gives elevation 88 meters ASL (which appears to take the ten-story
   building height into account).  I subtracted 32m for geoid height.

   John W. Briggs also writes : "796 Stamford Observatory is a facility
   owned by the Stamford Museum and Nature Center in Connecticut.  (It was
   the first domed observatory I ever entered as a youngster!) The
   instrument is an unusual 22-inch Gregory-Maksutov.  The dome still
   exists (although perhaps not for much longer).  I was visiting there
   within the last year."  John provides the following coordinates (with

   Jari also found a magazine article from 1985 in which Kari Kapanen
   describes his setup at (100) Ähtäri.  The article gave a lat/lon,
   but with the latitude seconds at 10",  not 01",  putting the observatory
   in water.  Jari contacted Kapanen's daughter-in-law to confirm the
   corrected location.  156m alt from G__gle Earth,  plus 18m geoid height.
   Google doesn't provide a good map;  Jari supplied a link to the much
   clearer National Land Survey map,
   https://kartta.paikkatietoikkuna.fi/?zoomLevel=11&coord=353344.4967_6946189.4187&showIntro=false
   The observatory (dismantled ~2000) reported exactly one observation,
   of C/1986 P1,  on 1986 Sep 27.  It was in the small square building
   SW of 142b on the 'background map'.  This is 5.8 km N of the (low
   precision) MPC location.

   MPC gives a link to astronomie.at for (563) Seewalchen,  the site for
   Sternwarte Gahberg,  which gives the coordinates below for (563a)
   after adding 45 meters for geoid height.  Robert Orso tells me the
   observations submitted to MPC were done by Martin Bressler at his
   site about 5.2 km to the north,  and has supplied the lat/lon used
   below for the "real" (563).

   MPC's list of Web sites for observatories gives (090)'s as
   astro-mainz.de,  which tells us that the observatory was on
   the roof of the Anne-Frank-Realschule from 1962 to 2011.
   (The MPC observations are all from 1985.)  That site appears in
   G__gle Earth,  with the dome clearly visible.  However,  Mike
   Kretlow (who grew up there and was a member of the astronomical
   societies in Mainz and Wiesbaden) tells me this isn't where
   the observations were made.  So it doesn't get the (090) code.

   http://www.obs-hp.fr/ohp_leaflet.pdf shows a site map identifying
   four telescopes at Haute-Provence Observatory.  The map is somewhat
   impressionistic,  and I was not 100% sure of (OH3) and (OH4) (other
   than that there are definitely domes there).   However,  Mike Kretlow
   sent me a map (http://stargate-ohp.de/pics/plan2b_gross.gif) and
   explanation of the site confirming that the leaflet was correct,
   marked SATINO,  and noted that Tuebingen is ROTAT.  I was then able

   Peter Birtwhistle writes : "...I can offer the original lat. and
   long. as supplied by the observers back then, I think generally by
   measuring off the British Ordnance Survey maps. I've taken a look at
   them in Google Earth and they may indeed be better than the co-ords
   in the MPC list but I can't prove that..."
   The positions are probably in a datum other than WGS84,  and there would
   be a datum shift of perhaps hundreds of metres.  But since the MPC
   positions have a precision of ~6.3 km in latitude and altitude,  these
   definitely represent an improvement.

   Peter writes : " I also took a look at 997 Hartwell which is only about
   34 miles from J95 [Peter's observatory] and found that it was the 19th
   century observatory of Dr John Lee and a reasonably detailed plan of
   the observatory building was published by Captain W.H. Smyth and now
   available via the Internet book archive. The observatory is long since
   demolished but I've measured the location of where the transit
   telescope and also the equatorial telescope were housed..."  Based on
   the old drawing,  Peter guesstimates a height of 3m for the transit
   telescope (which we think is the 'real' 997) and 5m for the equatorial,
   with a base altitude 83m ASL,  plus 47m for geoid height.

   Also,  note that this is _not_ the Seftenberg in Germany.  It is the Czech

   https://www.konkoly.hu/staff/racz/piszkesteto-en.html provides links
   to maps,  geodetic coordinates,  and other data for three telescopes at
   at Piszkéstető Mountain Station (Konkoly Observatory).  The geodetic
   coordinates are for the intersection of the RA/dec axes,  the very point
   you really want for orbital calculations.  Those coordinates are given
   below in their original degree/minutes/seconds form,  to 0.1 second.
   Much lower relative uncertainties are claimed,  but 0.1 second = about
   three meters.  They are about ten meters north and seven meters east of
   the coordinates measured from G__gle Earth (in decimal degrees,  in
   comments below).  I don't know who's wrong, and it may reflect a difference
   in geodetic datum.  For both sources,  a 43m geoid height is added.
      The Web site mentions a 40-cm scope with a roll-off roof,  but I
   wasn't able to identify it on Google Earth.  I think the '60/90/180 cm'
   designation for the Schmidt means a 60-cm corrector plate (the 'real'
   aperture),  90-cm spherical primary,  and 180-cm focal length.
      Krisztián Sárneczky tells me that (561) = the original MPC code for
   this site,  starting in the 1960s or 70s,  and used only the Schmidt
   telescope.  (The first observations in the MPC database from (561) are
   from 1974.)  I've moved (561) accordingly.  (K88) and (461) observations
   are split between the 1m RC and the Schmidt,  so I'm not moving either
   (K88) or (461) and am instead storing coordinates for the other scopes
   under new codes.
      Krisztián also tells me that the '50-cm Cassegrain' mentioned at the
   Konkoly Web site was retired in 2018 and replaced with an 80-cm RC.

   45m geoid height added to all Ondrejov alts.  The (557) position,  from
   Petr Pravec,  is where all observations since Nov 1993 were made.  About
   200 comet observations submitted for (557) between August 1992 and
   November 1993 were actually made from (On7),  an 18-cm scope on top of the
   Solar department building,  about 12m above ground;  Petr kindly pointed
   that one out and supplied lat/lon for it as well.  This is about a 0.5
   km difference;  I don't think it matters for any of the observations,
   but may be of historical interest.

   https://www.klet.org/en/telescopes says that Klet Observatory has two
scopes : a 1.06-m f/3 KLENOT scope and a 0.57-m f/5.2 reflector.  Two
domes show up in G__gle Maps,  but I don't actually know which dome is
which.  For the nonce,  I have put (246) KLENOT in the dome that is
~20m northeast of the dome I have labelled as (046).  Both points are
about 270 m north-northwest of the location given by MPC,  so even if
I do have them backwards,  it's an improvement over the current situation.

   (907) Melbourne reported three positions of C/1917 F1 in 1917,  and
then four more of 2P/Encke in 1918,  and then they gave up.  The following
position for (907) Melbourne Observatory is for the _current_ location
of the main dome at Melbourne Observatory,  about 210m north of the
location given by MPC.  This is a reconstruction of the original
observatory,  but I can't tell from on-line sources if it's in the
same place.  However,  the MPC coordinates are given to 0.00001 Earth
radius = 63m precision.  So I am at least not adding error by using
the following G__gle Earth coordinates.  5m added for geoid height.

   Note that (Q57) is unidentified at that map.
https://kmtnet.kasi.re.kr/kmtnet-eng/sites-data-process/ gives
a position matching the MPC's.  Both are about 80m west of the position
shown on the map at the KMTNet site... which lands nicely on the
only unidentified dome from the SSO map.

   The following position is from a GPS survey, from a private communication
   from Mike Nolan.  _Horizons_ uses an almost identical position,  except
   with altitude 450.557m.  Possibly an ellipsoid difference?  And a VLBI
   survey reported by Dave Graham differs by ~5 meters,  mostly in altitude
   (I don't know which way).  The MPC position is horrible,  about 90m south
   and at altitude 504m.  On G__gle Maps,  it's almost halfway off the dish.

   (Opt) is a 'floating' location,  used internally in Find_Orb.  It is the
   'best' topocentric location for observing an object at a given time (puts
   the object well above the horizon and the sun well below it),  and
   therefore moves around as the Earth rotates and the object moves around
   in the sky.
