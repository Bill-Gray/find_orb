# Site description for (310) MPC Test Code.
# This is just for illustrative purposes,  with a made-up telescope and
# abnormally complex irregular horizon.  Take this file and copy it to
# site_(your MPC code).txt,  and edit the parameters to fit what you
# have.  Comments can be added freely,  starting with '#'.

# Sites can also be described in 'scope.json'.  However,  a 'site_###.txt'
# file will be easier to read (JSON is intended for machine consumption,
# not human).  The following may help in puzzling out the JSON,  though
# (the keywords,  except for irregular horizons,  are the same.)  The
# data for this site is duplicated in 'scope.json',  simply for explanatory
# use.

# First,  you do have to specify your MPC code.

Site: 310

# Next,  parameters describing your telescope.  These are used to compute
# estimated exposure times and/or SNR levels in ephemerides.  The key ones
# to set involve filtering and scope size,  but the others can matter to
# a lesser degree.  You probably need not get nit-pickingly precise here.
# Exposure calculations tend to be a rough guideline anyway.

# Filter can be N (none), U, B, V, R, I, W.

Filter: N

# Primary diameter and central obstruction diameter are in cm.  I see a
# dome on G__gle Maps at the position given for (310),  right on MPC
# headquarters,  http://maps.google.com/maps?q=42.381468,-71.128360 .
# But I don't know what scope,  if any,  dwells inside.  Let's give
# 'em a 16-inch = 40-cm scope,  for demonstration purposes.

Primary: 40
Obstruction: 10

# Aperture, FWHM,  and PixelSize are in arcseconds.  Again,  no need
# to be all that precise here.

Aperture: 6
FWHM: 3
PixelSize: 2

# QE = quantum efficiency.  ReadNoise is in counts per pixel.

QE: 0.9
ReadNoise: 8

# SkyBrightness is the brightness of the sky at zenith on your best
# night.  It's basically an estimate of light pollution.  When Find_Orb
# computes sky brightness,  it will add this to light contribution from
# the sun,  moon,  airglow,  and (at some point,  haven't done these
# bits yet) zodiacal light and galactic background.  MPC is in the middle
# of Cambridge,  Massachusetts;  I assume their night sky is bright enough
# to read by.  But I'll set a darker,  during-power-outage level here.

SkyBrightness: 18.5

# By default,  we assume you can see from the horizon at 0 degrees
# right up to the zenith.  Alt/az scopes often have a bit of area
# near the zenith they can't see ("Dobson's Hole").  These,  and the
# following parameters,  are used in ephemerides to determine visibility;
# if you have 'suppress unobservables' ticked and the object would be
# outside these ranges,  ephemeris data won't be shown for that time.
# If you don't have that option checked,  the 'visibility indicator'
# (if checked) will warn you that the object isn't actually visible.
# You can also describe an irregular horizon,  as a series of alt/az
# points;  see below for that capability.  The limits can be combined
# to say "I can't see below this alt,  above this alt,  _and_ I can't
# see below the irregular horizon."

MinAlt: 0.0
MaxAlt: 90.0

# Equatorial scopes often can't quite slew to the poles due to an
# obstruction.  Some equatorials have a minimum or maximum hour angle,
# either due to mechanical obstructions or cables wrapping.  Default
# is to assume no such limits.  (Of course,  your horizon may impose
# such limits,  and unless you're at the equator,  it does.)

MinDec: -90.0
MaxDec: 90.0
MinHA: -180.0
MaxHA: 180.0

# Limits on elongation are somewhat rarer.  Hubble,  for example,  can't
# get closer than about 45 degrees to the sun.  WISE is always looking
# at close to 90 degrees from the sun.  SOHO's C3 camera can see quite
# close to the sun (MinElong = about 1 degree),  but can't look far
# from it (MaxElong = 9 degrees,  roughly.)

MinElong: 0.0
MaxElong: 180.0

# One can set up an irregular horizon,  instead of or in addition to the
# MinAlt/MaxAlt values given above.  To do so,  you give a series of points
# around the horizon as azimuth/altitude points.  Find_Orb will connect the
# points in the order they're given;  anything within the designated area
# will be considered as "under the horizon".  The last point is connected
# back to the first point.  Find_Orb connects "the short way";  if your points
# were 230 degrees apart clockwise,  it would go 150 degrees counterclockwise.
# To get around that,  just go in two (clockwise) steps of 115 degrees each.

# In this contrived example,  the horizon profile starts slightly west of
# north, works its way around the eastern horizon,  actually backs up a
# little in the south to let you peek a little under a tree,  and then goes
# around the west.  The last point at (300, 20) is connected back to the
# first one at (355, 10).  ASCII art representation follows.
