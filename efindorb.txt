1100    Astrometry redacted; click here for explanation

2000    The lat/lon specified for code (%s) in the header is malformed.\n
2000    See https://www.projectpluto.com/find_orb.htm#obs_codes for\n
2000    information about how to fix this.\n

2001    This shows very little motion and is probably a star.\n

2002    Didn't find observer (%s).  Observations will be excluded and
2002    treated as geocentric.

2003      You can fix this by downloading
2003    the current list of MPC stations at\n
2003    https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/lists/ObsCodes.html\n
2003    and saving it to the folder in which Find_Orb runs.

2004      You can read about how to add
2004    an XXX position for a new/temporary observer at\n
2004    https://www.projectpluto.com/find_orb.htm#xxx_code

2005    Didn't find observational bias data file
2005    To include the FCCT14 bias data,  Find_Orb needs
2005    the file 'bias.dat'.  There is more information
2005    about this at https://www.projectpluto.com/bias.htm
2005    Biases will not be applied until the file is available.

2006    Find_Orb can use the NEOCP ephemeris you've given it.
2006    However,  the ephemerides are geocentric.  You'll
2006    get much better results if you select a topocentric
2006    observatory code,  preferably one near the equator.
2006    (781) Quito is best for this purpose.

2007    The observations span %.1f years,  greater than Find_Orb's
2007    maximum span of %.1f years.  If you really want the whole
2007    set of observations (which may not process correctly),  edit
2007    'environ.dat' and look for the MAX_OBSERVATION_SPAN line.

2008    Not all satellite observations were read correctly.
2008    See https://www.projectpluto.com/sc_obs.htm for info on
2008    how to fix this,  or contact [email]rojectpluto.com.
2008    (In the latter case,  be sure to send the observation file.)

2009    %u observations were duplicates.  They have been removed.

2010    See https://www.projectpluto.com/sc_obs.htm FMI.

2011    %u observations were incorrectly formatted.  These observations
2011    will be ignored.

2012    %u observations are below the horizon.
2013    %u observations were taken in sunlight.
2014    These observations will be excluded.

2015    %u observations match in date and observatory code,
2015    but not in other regards.  They will be ignored.

2016    %u observations match in date, RA/dec, magnitude, and MPC
2016    code but not in other regards.  They will be ignored.

2017    %u observations are from spacecraft,  but aren't marked
2017    as such and lack the 'second line' offset data.  See\n
2017    https://www.projectpluto.com/sc_obs.htm
2017    https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/info/SatelliteObs.html
2017    \nfor info on how to handle spacecraft-based observations.

2018    %d observations have times in the future.  If that's
2018    not what you expected,  you should check the data.

2021    No asteroid ephemeris data is available,  so
2021    asteroid perturbations cannot be included.  You can
2021    fix this by downloading the necessary files.  See
2021    https://www.projectpluto.com/ast_pert.htm for details.

2025    further options.  Ctrl-click to select multiple observations.\n

2026    No observational header was provided with the observation(s).  Had one
2026    been provided,  you'd see information about who made and measured these
2026    data,  telescope used,  etc.\n

2027    Integrating from %.4f to %.4f runs outside Find_Orb's
2027    default time range.  If this is what you meant to do,  see\n
2027    https://www.projectpluto.com/find_orb.htm#time_range\n
2027    for instructions on how to extend the range.

2028    %d observations were read by Find_Orb,  but only after the format was
2028    corrected.  The observation would probably be rejected by MPC.  See
2028    https://www.projectpluto.com/fix_obs.htm for details.

2029    You don't currently have JPL planetary ephemerides set up
2029    for use in Find_Orb.  This will result in some loss of accuracy
2029    and speed.  See https://www.projectpluto.com/find_orb.htm#de_eph
2029    for further information.\n
2029    Hit any key to continue.  Find_Orb will still work,  though it will
2029    be a little slower and less accurate.  You should eventually download
2029    a JPL ephemeris file,  per the instructions at the above link.

2030    Your JPL ephemeris file, %s ,
2030    only covers the years %.1f to %.1f.  To cover your desired date
2030    range,  you'll need a different/larger JPL ephemeris file.  See
2030    https://www.projectpluto.com/find_orb.htm#de_eph for more info.
